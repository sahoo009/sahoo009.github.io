    - title: Lead AI and NLP Researcher
      institution: Department of Electrical Engineering, UMN
      year: 2019 - 2023
      description:
        - Developing grant proposals, writing journals, securing funding, exploring existing literature and state-of-the-art speech-to-text tools for project specific use cases, and increasing cross-collaboration with multiple teams across various institutions.
    - title: Deep Learning Researcher
      institution: Department of Surgery, UMN
      year: 2021 - 2023
      description:
        - Using ML and NLP techniques, developing a novel clinical annotation system for high-volume, real-time extraction and analysis of acute and long-term COVID-19 symptoms from unstructured patient notes. 
        - Comparable to other state-of-the-art clinical annotation systems, the developed system was the quickest, utilized little computational resources, and had good symptom extraction performance.
    - title: Health Futures Researcher
      institution: Microsoft
      year: 2022
      description:
        - Developed lesion detection pipeline to identify lesions (sprains, cartilage loss, fracture etc) present in a patientâ€™s MRI image reconstructed using undersampled data. 
        - In addition to detecting rare lesions, the pipeline had similar detection performance for MRI images reconstructed using no undersampling and MRI images reconstructed using an undersampling factor of 2, 4 and 8. 
    - title: Teaching Instructor
      institution: Department of Electrical Engineering, UMN
      year: 2016 - 2021
