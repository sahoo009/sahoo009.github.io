I am PhD candidate at University of Minnesota advised by [John Sartori](http://people.ece.umn.edu/users/jsartori/). My research focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) based fair, interpretable and novel clinical decision support solutions around healthcare related problems spanning multiple modalities (for example, audio, text, discrete and image data). With 6+ years of hands-on machine learning experience involving real world challenges, I also serve as the technical AI lead for a cross-collaborative project designed to address key limitations around CDS for some of the most rare and serious health-related diagnosis.
